## Using Add Chain Site

The [AddChain](https://addchain.welldonestudio.io) webpage provided by the WELLDONE Wallet makes your life much easier by letting you add networks seamlessly.

### 1. Search Chain and Connect Wallet

To begin, search for the chain you want to add, and click the **Connect Wallet** button at the top to grant access to your wallet. The button will change to **Add Chain** once the WELLDONE Wallet is successfully linked to the website.

### All That Node

The user can connect to the node provider's local node or the RPC node. We strongly advise you to use DSRV's [All That Node (ATN)](https://docs.allthatnode.com/), a multi-chain node platform that supports over 20 distinct protocols. Using ATN nodes makes it simple to employ multiple chain RPC nodes on a single platform seamlessly.

WELLDONE Wallet Extension would go active, then the `Add Network` window displays as seen below: To confirm that the network has been successfully added to your wallet, click the **Accept** button in the corresponding box. If the Deny button is selected, the error **User denied added chain** is returned.
