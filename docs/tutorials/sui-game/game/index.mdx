## Introduction
Study U&I is an educational game that can be fast, scalable, and transparent with mutable, fully on-chain NFTs and verifiable random function.

On this page, we provide the game and how to play. This page allows

1. an environment for users to upgrade their game items using Sui's VRF
- Step 1. Buying an item
- Step 2. Upgrading an item using Verifiable Random Function

2. an experience for users to connect a wallet and send transactions in a game that runs on Sui
- Dynamic NFT items are updated in real-time in the Explorer

For the detailed educational tutorial on full Smart Contract code used in the game, how to deploy and run it, and what is Verifiable Random Function and Dynamic NFTs, please go to [this page](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/tutorials/sui-game/).

## Instructions
### 1. Install WELLDONE Wallet
Before you begin, you'll need to install **WELLDONE Wallet** to access the game. For installation, see the [How to Install WELLDONE Wallet](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/wallet/manual/how-to-install).

The loading screen will continue if the **WELLDONE Wallet** is not installed, and the error `Please create SUI account` will appear if the **WELLDONE Wallet** is installed but the Sui account is not created.

### 2. Change to the testnet
The game contract is deployed on the testnet, so change the network to the testnet in your wallet.

### 3. Connect to WELLDONE Wallet
When the wallet pops up, click the `Accept` button to connect Wallet.

### 4. Faucet your account
You'll need to get funds to pay for gas. From your wallet, go to the Faucet tab, click the Request Faucet button, and wait for a second.
:::info
Our wallet uses cURL to request test tokens, and the testnet rpc is sometimes unstable. In that case, please refer to [this page](https://docs.sui.io/testnet/build/faucet).

### 5. SHOP
If the wallet connection is successful, your Sui address will appear in the top left corner of the screen. Then, go to the **SHOP**.
<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_3_1.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_3_1' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

Buy one `Axe` and one `Enchant Scroll`. Select each item in turn and click the blue button. When the wallet pops up, click the `Send` button to buy an item.
:::info
Your test account must have funds to pay for gas.

<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_3_2.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_3_2' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

After sending each transaction, you can look up the received Tx Hash in [SUI Explorer](https://suiexplorer.com/) to check the item that you bought.
<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_3_3.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_3_3' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

### 6. INVENTORY
In the **INVENTORY**, you can view the items you have.
<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_4_1.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_4_1' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

If you followed the previous steps, you may have one Axe and one Scroll. The number in the Axe item box indicates the level of the item. If you just bought the item, it will probably be `0`. 

And the number in the Scroll item box is the number of levels an item can be upgraded by spending that scroll.

### 7. UPGRADE
You will now spend a Scroll to enchant your Axe. Go to the **UPGRADE** and select the Axe and Scroll. 
<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_5_1.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_5_1' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

After enchanting, the level of the Axe will be 1 higher than its current level plus the level of the Scroll. This is because items are enchanted using the code below:

```rust
    item_axe.level = item_axe.level + item_scroll.level + bonus;
```

The `bonus` is determined by the value of the Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://docs.sui.io/learn/cryptography/ecvrf)) result. Study U&I uses Sui's VRF to enchant items.

<details>
  <summary>Why is the Verifiable Random Function important?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    VRF is important because users can provide a seed for the game company to generate a random value, and users can always verify that the game company used that seed to generate the random. Therefore it is transparent.
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

However this demo version doesn't have a backend server, so it uses a pre-generated fixed VRF value. Therefore, the value of the `bonus` is always `1`.

For the full Study U&I Smart Contract code, how to deploy it, and more information about VRF, check out the [Building a Game on Sui with VRF and Dynamic NFTs](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/tutorials/sui-game/#smart-contract-update-item).

Click the enchant button. When the wallet pops up, click the `Send` button to enchant an item.

### 8. Last Step
After enchanting, you can check in your inventory or [Sui Explorer](https://suiexplorer.com/) that the Scroll was burned and the Axe leveled up. The image of the Axe will also change based on the specific item level.

<img src={require('./img/study_u_and_i_6_2.png').default} alt='study_u_and_i_6_2' style={{width: '650px'}}/>

The current version focuses more on how to use VRF in the game, rather than the gameplay. For gameplay, stay tuned for our next series.
