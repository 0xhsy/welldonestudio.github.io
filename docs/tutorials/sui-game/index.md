# Build a Game on Sui with VRF and Dynamic NFTs

## Introduction

Here is a educational game prototype that can be fast, scalable and transparent with mutable, fully on-chain NFTs and verifiable random. Sui has a lot of unique features. Sui’s unique language, Move is awesome: It’s safe, efficient for blockchain and resistant to vulnerabilities such as reentrancy. But without move expertise, here's an easy way to create a game on Sui, with a web IDE that doesn't require any development setup. And let's take a look at how Sui's unique features, such as dynamic NFTs and VRF, can enhance the gaming experience.

## Code Tutorials

### Smart Contract: Weapon Struct

```rust
    /// Weapon NFT
    struct Weapon has key, store {
        id: UID,
        name: string::String,
        description: string::String,
        url: Url,
        /// TODO: add custom attributes
        power: u8,
    }
```

### Smart Contract: Ownership

```rust
    struct Ownership has key {
        id: UID
    }

    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let ownership = Ownership {
            id: object::new(ctx),
        };
        /// Transfer the ownership object to the module/package publisher
        transfer::transfer(ownership, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

```

Use the `Ownership` object to ensure that only authorized people can mint and modify NFTs. In this example, the authorized people is the module/package publisher (the game company). Transfer the `Ownership` object to the publisher in the `init` function, which is executed only once when deploying the smart contract.

### Smart Contract: Create Weapon

```rust
    /// Create a new Weapon
    public entry fun mint(
        _: &Ownership,
        name: vector<u8>,
        description: vector<u8>,
        url: vector<u8>,
        recipient: address,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        let nft = DevNetNFT {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            name: string::utf8(name),
            description: string::utf8(description),
            url: url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(url),
            power: 0
        };

        transfer::public_transfer(nft, recipient);
    }
```

Only addresses that own the `Ownership` object can call the `mint` function.

### Smart Contract: Request Updating Weapon

```rust    
    /// An object for consign
    struct ConsignedObj has key, store {
        id: UID,
        /// owner of the consigned object
        sender: address,
        /// the consigned object
        weapon: Option<ID>,
    }
```

`ConsignedObj` is an object for consigning an item to the game company to request an update to the item.


```rust
    /// `users` create an consign for consigning
    /// an item to `game_company`
    public entry fun create(
        third_party: address,
        weapon: Weapon,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        let sender = tx_context::sender(ctx);
        let consigned = ConsignedObj { id: object::new(ctx), weapon: option::none(), sender: sender };
        
        option::fill(&mut consigned.weapon, object::id(&weapon));
        dynamic_object_field::add(&mut consigned.id, 0, weapon);

        // consign the object with the trusted third party
        transfer::public_transfer(consigned, third_party);
    }
```

Users can call the `create` function to request enchanting their item.

### Smart Contract: Update Weapon
```rust
    /// `users` create an consign for consigning
    /// an item to `game_company`
    public entry fun create<Weapon: key + store>(
        third_party: address,
        consigned: Weapon,
        ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        let sender = tx_context::sender(ctx);
        let id = object::new(ctx);
        // consign the object with the trusted third party
        transfer::public_transfer(
            ConsignedObj<Weapon> {
                id, sender, consigned
            },
            third_party
        );
    }
```
Trusted third party can enchant an item. There are three main parts to enchanting.

1. Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://docs.sui.io/learn/cryptography/ecvrf))
The `enchant` function takes parameters a random `output`, `alpha_string`, `public_key`, and `proof` generated by the game company via VRF. Then inside the function, the random is verified, and if it passes, the result random output determines whether the item is enchanted or not.

2. Dynamic NFTs
If the random output determines that the item enchant, change the properties of the NFT. These items such as weapon, and armour are all Dynamic NFTs on-chain. As you enchant your item with the scroll, attributes such as power, delay, and durability are all updated live.

3. Return NFT to the user who requested the enchanting
Using the `ConsignedObj`, return NFT to the user who requested the enchanting.

## Deploy Smart Contract with Welldone Code

:::info
Please refer to [here](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/code/getting-started) to get started.

### New Project

Automatically generate a contract structure. Click the `Create` button to create a contract structure.

<img src={require('./img/new-project-sui.png').default} alt='template-code-sui' style={{width: '50%'}}/>

:::info
You can create your own contract projects without using the features above. However, for the remix plugin to build and deploy the contract, it must be built within the directory `sui/`. If you start a new project, the structure should look like the following.
:::

  ```
  sui
  └── weapon
      ├── Move.toml
      ├── Move.lock
      └── sources
          └── weapon.move

### Compile The Source Code

Select the project you want to compile. For now, let's choose `sui/weapon` and click `Compile` button.


### Deployment 
If the compilation succeed, you can see mv file `weapon.mv`.

Click the `Deploy` button.


and you can see wallet popup. Let's click `Send` button.

### Check Out Deployed Contract
After deployment, you can see weapon module and functions.

### Calling Contract Functions
1. Select `mint` function. First parameter is Ownership object id. 
You can get the object id in the terminal log which shows for above deployment transaction result.
The second through third parameters are the name, description, and url of the NFT to mint, in that order.
The fourth parameter is the address to which the minted NFTs will be sent.

2. After mint transaction, check if Weapon was minted in [SUI Explorer](https://suiexplorer.com/).

3. Run the `create` function with the recipient's account that you entered in the 4th parameter in step 1.
The first parameter is the type of Weapon NFT you want to update. The second parameter is the address where you deployed this smart contract. The third parameter is the object ID of the Weapon NFT you want to update.

4. Return to the account where you deployed the smart contract and run the `enchant` function.

5. After enchant transaction, check if Weapon was returned to the user and updated in [SUI Explorer](https://suiexplorer.com/).
