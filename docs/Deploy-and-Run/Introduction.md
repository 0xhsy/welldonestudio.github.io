Since the smart contract development environment differs from networks, developers must reconstruct the development environment whenever the targeted network changes.

Using the web-based Remix IDE, developers can quickly write and test EVM-based smart contracts.

WELLDONE Studio also offers **WELLDONE Code**, which allows chains backed by WELLDONE wallets to write smart contracts in Remix IDE for non-EVM networks, in addition to EVM-compatible networks.

**WELLDONE Code** is a wonderful tool for onboarding developers in any blockchain ecosystem since it allows them to write smart contracts without the need for building a separate development environment.

## Features

1. Multi-chain support
2. Simple way to deploy contracts and perform functions.
