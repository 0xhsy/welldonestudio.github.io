After installing and launching the WELLDONE Wallet, you must confirm that there are objects available in the new browser tab `window.dapp` developer console. This is the way your website communicates with the WELLDONE Wallet. The guide below will guide you further.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
