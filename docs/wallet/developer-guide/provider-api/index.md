# Provider API

:::info
We recommend you go through [the basics](https://docs.welldonestudio.io/getting-started) before reading the material.
:::

WELLDONE Wallet injects a global API known as `window.dapp` into the website that you visit. You may use the `window.dapp` API to request a user's account from a website, query data from a blockchain to which the user is linked, and let the user sign messages and transactions.

If you're wondering about how you can send requests to many chains with `WELLDONE Wallet` and how we support a multichain environment, check out the documentation below.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
