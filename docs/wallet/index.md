# Wallet

**WELLDONE Wallet** is an integrated, non-custodial wallet that allows you to freely manage your assets across any network. Navigate smoothly between chains and explore what Web3 has to offer. All your eggs in one basket.

Currently supports a total of nine industry leaders: Celestia, Celo, Cosmos, Ethereum, Juno, Klaytn, NEAR, Neon, and Solana. Expect to see more EVM-compatible chains, Cosmos-based chains, and others like Sui and Aptos. And thatâ€™s just the beginning.
