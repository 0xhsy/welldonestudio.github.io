# Wallet

WELLDONE Wallet is an integrated, non-custodial wallet that allows you to freely manage your assets across any network. Navigate smoothly between chains and explore what Web3 has to offer. All your eggs in one basket.

Currently supports a total of seven industry leaders: Ethereum, Near, Solana, Celo, Cosmos, Neon, and Klaytn. Expect to see more EVM-compatible chains, Cosmos-based chains like Juno, and others like Sui and Aptos. And thatâ€™s just the beginning.
